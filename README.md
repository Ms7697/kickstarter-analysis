Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Purpose

  The play “Fever” came close to its fundraising goal in a short period of time. Louise wants to see how other fundraising campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals using the Kickstarter data. Analyzing the data will provide helpful information to determine when to launch her campaign and her fundraising goals. 

Analysis and Challenges

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
  The analysis on theater outcomes based on launch dates, a pivot table was created showing the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. We filtered by month based on all the included years in the provided Kickstarter data. Next, we plotted that data on a line graph. This helps us examine and visualize the data between outcomes and launch month. This information helps provide data to effectively see which months fundraising goal amount will be successful or a failure.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  Using data from the Kickstarter, noting how many successful, failed, and canceled campaigns relating the outcome based on goals.  To analyze the outcomes based on goals, we turned our attention to the “Play” subcategory.  Being able to determine each outcome, we converted the data into percentile to see the rate of how each “play” fared. Putting all the data on to a platted line graph to visualize the relationship between goal ranges and outcomes.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

  During Deliverable #2, we hade a few errors along the way. Getting the “Countifs” correctly with a range under the 1000 goal was simple. But entering between a range, I had multiple errors and had to do trial and error with the formulas to get the correct data to output. Difficulties that could be encountered is that we subcategorized the data to “Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date”, in the first deliverable.  Then we subcategorized the data to only “Plays” in the 2nd Deliverable. This may factor into the results Louise is looking for in order to have a successful campaign.

Results

  The “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch date” graph, you can see that most of the theatres began in April. All year long the outcomes were successful except in December. Where the successful and failed theater campaigns were nearly similar. But you can conclude that the Campaigns that were launched in April, May, June, July were high successful rates compared to the rest of the year. We can also conclude that December is a month to avoid when launching theatre campaigns. Looking at the graph in Outcomes Based on Goal, we can see that most successful goal was under 5000 and between 35,000 & 45,999. They had a 67% and higher successful rate. The range between 35,000 and 45,999 is also successful but only a 9 project were accounted for.  So, Louise target should be under 5000, where over 500 projects were accounted for. Which gives a more accurate result.
